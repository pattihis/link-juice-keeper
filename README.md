# Link Juice Keeper
Wordpress plugin to handle 404 errors with custom redirections

## == Description ==

`Page not found` ( status 404 ) errors are very common and they are one of the main reasons a search engine, like Google, can give you a lower ranking. Taking steps to handle 404 errors can be complex for non-techy users. With this free plugin you can finally eliminate all 404 errors with just 1 click, once and for all!

### What are 404s?

As you probably know, incoming links play important role in ranking well in Google and other search engines. Therefore you should assure that every incoming link leads to one of your valid pages on your blog. This may be a challenge because your website is dynamic, it changes every day:

* you might remove or unpublish posts or pages;
* you might change your URL structure on your blog;
* links may brake because of technical misconfiguration;
* a webmaster might add your link in their posts with a typo;
* a visitor may simply mis-type your post's URL

Any of the above will lead to link juice waste and a 404 error. You can avoid this simply by installing this plugin. It redirects all non-existing URLs, which normally return a 404 error, to the page/post of your choice. This way everyone who comes to your blog via a broken link (both people and robots) will be redirected to a valid page.

### Features
